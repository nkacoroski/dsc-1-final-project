# Module 1 Final Project

The final for Module 1 of the Flatiron Data Science Program is a partner project. This repo contains all the project material for David Kaspar and Natasha Kacoroski. 

Our objectives are listed in the `"index.ipnyb"` file. The dataset we used is the  `"kc_house_data.csv"` file, and consists of modified data from the King County House Sales dataset. The description of the column names can be found in the column_names.md file. Our goal was to clean, explore, and model the dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible. The [`king_county_housing_prediction_model.ipynb`](king_county_housing_prediction_model.ipynb) file documents our work process. The `"blog.ipnyb"` is our blog draft. You can see it on our individual blogs [Natasha Kacoroski Blog](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natashakacoroski/detail/recent-activity/posts/) and [David Kaspar Blog](https://dev.to/upwardtrajectory/engineering-location-features-with-haversine-s-formula-for-prediction-modeling-23n2). The pdf of our presentation is the [`predicting_house_sales_presentation`](predicting_house_sales_presentation.pdf) file. 

Enjoy!
